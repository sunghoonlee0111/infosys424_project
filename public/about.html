                of a single home.

              group started at Baylor University in 1987 under its affiliate in
              Waco, TX. The Campus Chapter at University of Wisconsin-Madison is
              one of more than 500 campus chapters around the country. Our
              chapter was founded in the Fall of 1993, just 5 years after our
              affiliate, Habitat for Humanity of Dane County.

            <p class="about_our_history_contents_2">
              In the 1995-1996 school year, 6 of our members were invited to
              hear Millard Fuller (Habitat’s co-founder) speak in Milwaukee,
              where the chapter’s intentions were set: fundraise and build its
              own house. In 2000, the chapter’s first sponsored house was built,
              and the chapter has been able to build each year since. The
              chapter is largely able to build because of its largest
              fundraiser, the annual SouperBowl, which was thought up by then
              high school art teacher Don Hunt in 1995, just two short years
              after the founding of the group. Other major past fundraisers
              include the annual Tour de Habitat and Huffin for Habitat.

              Today, Habitat for Humanity-UW Madison generates enough funding to
              sponsor a Habitat for Humanity home each year. Students from
              University of Wisconsin-Madison as well as Habitat members
              volunteer for 14 build days a year, along with newly added ReStore
              days. Today, the chapter holds Spring and Fall yard cleaning
              initiatives, manages stadium chair installation in a section at
              Camp Randall Stadium, works concessions at Badger sporting events,
              and prepares several small scale fundraisers. On top of
              fundraising, Habitat participates in Act! Speak! Build! Week
              through various forms of marketing, simulations, and meetings with
              local representatives. With over 150 active members and growing,
              our volunteers contribute over 1500 hours each year!
